# jekyll-with-commenting
A Jekyll site with a comment system

This is a template jekyll site with a comment system.

Comments are stored as YAML files and rendered at the bottom of the corresponding posts.

To enable the "submit new comment" function, you will also have to set up some sort of server backend. Check out <a href="https://takmanman.github.io/2020/04/22/github-page-aws-lambda.html" target ="_blank">this tutorial</a> on a "serverless" approach using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.
